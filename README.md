# MyHealthQR-Project-
  This project focuses on developing a secure, user-friendly web application that enhances patient care by providing real-time access to critical medical information through QR code scanning. The system is designed to support healthcare providers, first responders, patients, and guardians by enabling efficient patient profile management, care plan updates, and quick access to emergency medical details.

Key features include:

  - QR Code-Based Access: Each patient will have a unique QR code for streamlined identification, allowing healthcare providers and first responders to access vital medical details instantly.
  - Patient Profile Management: Users can create, update, and control the visibility of their personal and medical information.
  - Quick Help Option: Enables third parties to quickly retrieve critical medical information during emergencies.
  - Security & Role-Based Access Control: Ensures data protection through role-based permissions, authentication mechanisms, and audit trails.
  - System Administration: Admins will have control over user data management, including access and deletion rights.
